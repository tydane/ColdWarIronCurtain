 heavy_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Heavy Fighter I"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Heavy Fighter I"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Our bomber force needs escort protection from enemy fighters all the way to their targets and back. In order to provide this escort, we must design fighter aircraft with bomber range. Out of necessity these aircraft are larger, slower and less agile than light fighters, though they can carry significant armament."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Heavy Fighter II"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Heavy Fighter II"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The war has taught us that our heavy fighter design is vulnerable to more nimble fighters, but quite good at the interception of enemy bombers due to heavy armament. This next design will focus on increased attack capability against enemy aircraft and even ground targets. Its speed and range will be improved as well."
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Heavy Fighter III"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "Heavy Fighter III"
 heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Though our heavy fighter force has shown adeptness in various roles, we must consider a new design that will enhance its ability relative to enemy fighters, as well as allow it to continue intercepting increasingly faster and better defended enemy bombers."
 strat_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Strategic Bomber I"
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Strat Bomber I"
 strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experiences from the Great War and studies since show that bombing the enemy's military targets and major cities will win the next war. At the very least, we must have a bomber capable of delivering such destruction. It will need to fly high and at good speed, and it must carry a large payload. This will require a large airframe with multiple engines. It will also have some defensive capability."
 strat_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Strategic Bomber II"
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Strat Bomber II"
 strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Bombing has proven effective at reducing the enemy's capacity to wage war. More defensive weaponry and increased speed will allow a new design to avoid destruction, while increasing the payload and range will make it more effective."

 tac_bomber_equipment_0:0 "Interwar Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "It is widely believed that the next war will be won entirely by bombing the enemy to extinction. It is imperative that we begin designing our own bomber plane that is capable of carrying heavy payloads at adequate speed."
 tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Tactical Bomber I"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Tac Bomber I"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Medium bombers need to be versatile and fast, capable of fulfilling a range of roles. A twin-engine design, remaining relatively light, can continue to be of use for many years to come."
 tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Tactical Bomber II"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Tac Bomber II"

 aerosub_0:0 "Prototype Flying Submarine"
 aerosub_0_short:0 "AEROSUB I"
 aerosub_0_desc:0 "The flying submarine is an amphibious naval bomber plane capable of submerging itself to evade enemy anti-air fire and improve stealth. Using either air or sea cover, the flying submarine is more defensible at a substantial cost and tradeoff to performance.\nOriginally thought of by unnamed British high command officers and reported in the British trade journal 'flying', the flying submarine, or 'aerosub' was rarely ever taken seriously. In the late 30s to mid 50s, the Soviet Union took serious steps to try and create an aerosub but the project failed miserably. It would not be explored again until the early 60s where Donald Reid would design an amphibious submersible single seat aircraft that was far simpler in concept to the aerosub pursued by the Soviet Union. However, in 2008, the US DARPA agency announced it would begin to reexplore the aerosub concept."

Right before WW2, Boris Ushakov from the Dzerzhinsky Naval Engineers' Academy proposed the concept of a flying submarine, a naval bomber that could become submerged or reemerge at will to conduct naval bombing operations. The project was brought up multiple times by Ushakov in the following years and eventually, in 1938, was explored in a mildly serious capacity. The substantial complexity of the design was prohibitive and eventually, the project was eventually cancelled in 1939. However, in 1943, Lavrentiy Beria revived the project and in 1947, the first test was performed. In 1953 the project was eventually cancelled by Khrushchev due to the impracticality of it and the fact that progress was virtually nonexistent as it couldn't even fly properly."

The F-35 program began development in 1992, with the A variant taking to the skies in late 2006 and dropping its first bombs less than six years later. The A variant is the smallest and lightest variant of F-35 and is primarily intended to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Republic of Korea was one of many allied nations to purchase F-35s."

The upgrade also included but was not limited to new avionics, such as a modern cockpit display, new IFF, and later on, an upgraded AN/ALR-68 RWR."

Operated by Soviet Naval Aviation, the Il-4 operated as a makeshift torpedo and dive-bomber, although it was mostly ineffective in the latter due to its large wing-span (it was more likely for the wings to rip off once a high speed was achieved.)

Unlike the land-based version, the Il-6P had a different engine set, as the need for long-range was largely negated due to it being on an aircraft carrier. As a result, performance had largely improved to be of comparable level to the Il-4 that it was originally based on.

 VIN_jet_multirole_equipment_2_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the most iconic fighters of the Cold War, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 Fagot entered service in 1947. The MiG-15 was involved in many conflicts since its introduction in the Korean War, where it proved a worthy adversary to the American F-86 Sabre and F9F Panther. A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations. While most aircraft were decommissioned in the 1950's, some still remain in service with the North Korean Air Force."

In total 20 nations used the MiG-17, spanning Africa, Europe and Asia. Its first combat deployment was in 1958, when PRC MiGs clashed with Nationalist Chinese F-86 Sabres over the Taiwan Strait. However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war. The MiG-17 was generally decommissioned in the 1970's, while it still remains in limited service in some African nations and North Korea."
