 greece.0.t:0 "Death of a Prime Minister"
 greece.0.d:0 "	Today Greece mourns one of its children. Themistoklis Sofoulis, our prime minister passed away at the age of 88. He was born in 1860 in Vathy in the island of Samos. He studies philosophy in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and then went to Germany where he specialized in archaeology. He entered in the Greek political arena after the declaration of union between Samos and Greece in 1913. Prior to this, he was involved in the Samian politics and played a big part on the union process. In the election of May 1915, Sofoulis was elected deputy in the Greek parliament and served as Interior Minister under Eleftherios Venizelos. When in 1920 Venizelos became self-exiled, Sofoulis took the leadership of the party. In 1924 he became Prime Minister for the first time. During the interwar period Sofoulis was one of the central political figures in Greece. After the Greece surrender to the Axis in 1941, Sofoulis remained passive as almost all Greek Politician. After the liberation, he became Prime Minister until April of 1946 and tried to prevent the outbreak of the civil war. However his efforts failed and as a result he abstained from politics for a short period of time. On 7 September 1947 he once again became prime minister in a coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party. Sofoulis undertook further efforts to end the civil war, by proposing to EAM a general amnesty and a new coalition government between it and his party. However, these proposals were collapsed under heavy USA pressure and so the civil war took its course."

 greece.1.t:0 "Alexandros Diomidis"
 greece.1.d:0 "After the death of Themistoklis Sofoulis, Alexandros Diomidis, the vice-president of the cabinet, becomes acting Prime Minister"
 greece.1.r:0 "We will see how this goes.."
 greece.2.t:0 "Alexandros Diomidis remains Prime Minister"
 greece.2.d:0 "After a few days of negotiations the Laiko Komma and the Komma Fileleutheros agreed to support Alexandros Diomidis as successor to Sofoulis in the premiership. Diomidis takes office on the 30 of July 1949, with the Civil war still going.."
 greece.2.r:0 "Difficult days for Diomidis..."
 greece.3.t:0 "Uniting the democratic faction"
 greece.3.d:0 "The old Venizelist faction is still split in various bigger and smaller parties. This makes very difficult to antagonize the Right which even though now is in the opposition, it seems that is gets stronger day by day. We focused many times on united the various Venizelists into one party, but the attempts were unsuccessful. However, a last chance to achieve that impossible goal is standing ahead..."
 greece.4.t:0 "Electoral reform debate"
 greece.4.d:0 "It is widely acknowledged that our current electoral system failed to provide the country with stable governments that are able to fulfill their term. As a result there is an increasing amount of voices advocating for a radical reform of the current system. They support that it is essential for the future of Greece to move towards an enhanced majority system in order to acquire stable governments and move away from fragile multiparty parliamentary majorities. Also both the US embassy and the Palace are clearly in favor of the enhance majority system. It would not be wise to oppose them. However, behind the proposed system there are dangers. We should forget that Papagos party came first in the elections, even though he failed to form a government. Adopting the enhanced majority system, we might unknowingly give him a strong one-party majority in the next parliament. "
 greece.6.t:0 "Alexandros Papagos Dies"
 greece.6.d:0 "In January 1955 prime minister Alexandros Papagos began to develop gastric issues, a result of his previous imprisonment during the war. Thus, he appointed Stefanopoulos to serve as provisional prime minister until he overcomes his illness. However, Papagos' condition kept worsening, until today, when our prime minister left his last breath due to a severe lung hemorrhage."
 greece.7.t:0 "Karamanlis sworn Prime Minister"
 greece.7.d:0 "After Papagos death, King Paul in a surprising move, appoints Konstantinos Karamanlis as Prime Minister. Karamanlis appointment took the Greek political life by surprise, because the King bypassed two senior members of Papagos party, Stephanos Stephanopoulos and Panagiotis Kanellopoulos who were widely considered as potential successors of Papagos. After becoming Prime Minister, Karamanlis reorganized the Ellinikos Synagermos as the Ethniki Rizospastiki Enosi."
 greece.8.d:0 "This morning, we received horrifying accounts that a series of earthquakes with a combined magnitude of approximately 6.8 hit the Ionian Islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos. Two British Royal Navy vessels were the first on the scene to provide emergency aid and in initial reports the damage to the region appears to be severe. So far, casualties have been estimated to be at least 400 people dead and wounded, and the economic impacts of the quake appear extensive, as several top economists have already estimated the financial cost of the earthquake to extend into the billions."
 greece.9.d:0 "Prime Minister [GRE.GetLeader] has introduced new legislation! In reaction to the ongoing epidemic of young rabble rousers, the legislation has now allowed for punishment of their silly pranks and harsh words. Along with penalizing the use of foul language such as \"gamo teen Panagia sou,\" \"skeela,\" and \"malakas,\" the law also gives specific penalties for rapscallions who throw food onto or assault old people. Specifically, they will be taken to their local detention center, their heads shaved, and their parents prosecuted. Further, they will be shamed in the streets for their crimes! Though some protest the law due to its punishments, many celebrate [GRE.GetLeader]'s solution to the rampaging youths."
 greece.10.d:0 "Greece's close alliance and cooperation with the United States has preserved its independence since the turbulent 1940s. The Greek people had dealt with occupation forces from Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In addition the nation has only recently come out of a Civil War which saw the defeat of the Greek communists. The outbreak of the Korean War has seen the United States call on all its friends and allies to contribute to the cause. Many in the cabinet and senior military officers believe Greece should offer equipment and men to demonstrate its commitment to its American allies and anti-communism. However, many politicians and everyday Greeks are of the opinion the country is too war weary and should not be involved in foreign wars. However, after close negotiations with its party members and political allies, the Greek Prime Minister was able to convince them to support a Greek intervention in Korea. The Greek military is now drawing up options with their American counterparts on how Greece can contribute to the struggle against communism in Korea. Supporters of the intervention say like the Greeks, the South Koreans are victims of communist aggression and it is only fitting that the Greeks come to aid them in their desperate defense."

PDG.1.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the execution of Stefanos Sarafis. Sarafis, who commanded the DRG General Staff during the civil war was killed on the orders of Chairman Nikos Zachariadis. The government claimed Sarafis had questionable ties overseas and his motivations for joining the DRG were always suspect. The government noted Sarafis was not a party member before the war and only joined when captured. Analysts suspect the execution is a move meant to consolidate the position of Zachariadis as the head of both the party and military."
PDG.2.d:0 "Following the victory of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) in the recent civil war, the new government has initiated a Red Terror across Greece. Those accused of collaborating with the fascists during the Axis occupation, supporters of the Kingdom of Greece, and those within the party whose loyalty is suspect are being arrested. There are already reports of summary executions and new courts being established. The DRG is calling on all Greeks to help the communist party identify traitors and claim the revolution can only begin flourish once all internal enemies are dealt with."
PDG.3.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. This marks a major shift in the communist party following the takeover of the party by reformists during the recent Congress Meeting. The reformists fear the hardline wing of the party was far too aligned with the Soviet Union and initiating policies that were alienating the population. They feared this would eventually lead to either a violent uprising or Greece being dragged into another major war. The Soviet Union announced an emergency session of the Politburo will be called to discuss the situation in Greece."
PDG.4.d:0 "In a surprise shift, former communist party chairman Nikos Zachariadis regained control of the party. It appears the reformists attempt to shift away from Moscow backfired. Most communist members, were already uncomfortable with the new direction from Moscow, but also oppose the reformist agenda. They see Nikos Zachariadis as the best hope for the fledging communist regime. Zachariadis already rejects the new direction being advocated by the Soviets and remains committed to keeping Greece on a true revolutionary path."
PDG.5.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it will not oppose the decision of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) to leave the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet action will be well-received by the reformist faction currently controlling the Greek communist party. It appears the Soviets wish to depart from the hardline stance of the Stalin era and show it can maintain relations with socialist states not in its umbrella. The Soviets may have also calculated its action will help the party solidify its control of Greece. Whether Greece will reciprocate and keep strong bilateral ties remains to be seen."
PDG.6.d:0 "Famed Greek communist military and guerilla leader Marshal Markos Vafeiadis has taken control of the party and the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Although an established military commander, he had a falling out with former leader Nikos Zachariadis and had at one point been exiled to Moscow. Vafeiadis is seen as a believer in an independent Greece with a strong admiration for the socialist leader Josep Tito. Whether he can guide Greece towards a non-aligned socialist state remains to be seen." 
PDG.7.d:0 "President Charilaos Florakis, an established communist statesman, has taken control of the communist party. Although a firm member of the party, Forakis was rumored to be among of those most concerned with the hardline approach of Nikos Zachariadis and his faction. Many observers and Greek expect a relaxation of policies and a more inclusive approach. His first statement upon assuming power appears to support this as he called on all Greeks to come together and heal in peace."
PDG.8.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece submitted an application to join NATO. Recent reforms saw an unprecedented democratization across the country. The political transformation of the government and reforms has transformed Greece into a state incompatible with the Soviet Union or what it views as a socialist state. Another motivation to join NATO is a fear that the Soviets may chose clandestine or even over means to stop the new direction of Greek socialism. Many members of NATO see the potential inclusion of the DRG as a major victory both strategically and politically."
PDG.9.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) declared its support of anti-revisionism. Greek communists are in an uproar over the recent actions by the Soviet Union to condemn Stalinism and move away from its positions. The DRG believes what the Soviets call reforms is in reality a shift away from revolutionary socialism towards state capitalism. The DRG states it will continue to champion socialism and urge all socialist states to remain steadfast."
PDG.10.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the centuries long struggle for enosis has finally been achieved. DRG aid proved critical in forcing the withdrawal of Britain from Cyprus and its capture by Greek Cypriotes. The DRG also succeeded in breaking up and purging the EOKA of its royalist and clergy leadership to transform the Cypriote resistance group into a revolutionary force. In response to threats coming from Turkey, the DRG stated it will not compromise or give up on bringing socialism to all Greek peoples."
PDG.11.d:0 "Mount Athos, a historic and important center of the Greek Orthodox Church monasticism has been closed by the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Mount Athos, an island in northeastern Greece, has for centuries been the home of monasteries and monks. Under the Greek constitution of 1927 the island enjoyed autonomy and administered itself. However, government troops recently stormed the island and removed all the monks. The DRG stated it had liberated the island for the people and eliminated the corrupt influence of the church. Although the government is hailing its actions as a victory, many Greeks are likely to view this direct attack on religion negatively."
PDG.12.d:0 "Greece opened its first government session in Constantinople, officially moving the capital of the country to the city. The Democratic Government of Greece (DRG) received the city and its surrounding area following the partition of Turkey by the Soviet Union. The shift to the capital appears to be the final step of the integration of these lands. For the Greek communists, the return of Constantinople as the capital symbolizes the unification of Greece and its people under socialism."
PDG.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union launched a blistering condemnation of the continued British occupation of Cyprus. The Soviets note the hypocrisy of Britain and its allies who call for self-determination in socialist states when it is openly suppressing the wishes of the Cypriote people. The Soviet diplomatic offensive will put the British under intense pressure. The Soviet focus on Cyprus appears to be a response to requests from the communist Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG. The DRG continues to champion the cause for the decolonization of Cyprus and its unification with Greece. Many Greeks feel a kinship with the Cypriote Greeks who make up the majority of the population on Cyprus."
PDG.14.d:0 "The United Nations voted to admit the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). This is a major diplomatic victory for the new communist state as it consolidates its control over the country following a violent civil war. The socialist nations all voted to admit Greece, along with many newly independent states. A number of allies for the former Kingdom of Greece either abstained or voted against the admission in protest."
PDG.15.d:0 "The Greek Civil War has ended in victory for the Communist Party of Greece. The new regime quickly announced the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Greece. This marks the end of the Kingdom of Greece. Many socialist states have already recognized the new government, announcing plans to establish or expand embassies in the country. Allies of the defunct Kingdom of Greece have closed their embassies but will likely return in time. The people of Greece anxiously await what the new regime will bring."
PDG.16.d:0 "Markos Vafeiadis, famed communist Greek resistance and military leader was ousted from the party and is said to be in exile. His removal followed an intense investigation of party leaders. Vafeiadis was accused of harboring divergent revolutionary views. Due to the threat he poses to the internal security and revolutionary path of Greece, he has been voted out of the party. Markos Vafeiadis, fearing arrest, fled to Moscow where he denies the accusations against him. His removal will severely weaken the position of his supporters within the party."
PDG.17.d:0 "Millions of ethnic Turks are currently being driven out of the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). Greek officials and troops are organizing the deportations of what the government calls a dangerous fifth column within the state. The Greek action is being widely criticized internationally and the Turkish government is accusing the DRG of creating a refugee crisis in Anatolia. Greece recently took possession of Turkish lands following the partition of the country by the Soviet Union."
PDG.18.d:0 "Following its occupation of Izmir and Istanbul following the Soviet partition of Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced it was renaming the cities. Izmir will return to its Greek name of Smyrna while Istanbul will become Constantinople. The Greek government claims this is a return to the historic norm and that for centuries these Greek lands had been occupied by Turkish invaders. Many Greeks welcome the move, though there is international concern over the fate of Turks still living in these cities."
PDG.19.d:0 "Following a failed attempt by reformists to take control of the Communist Party of Greece, Chairman Nikos Zachariadis announced the execution of Charliaos Florakis. Florakis was tried for having counter-revolutionary tendencies and close association with enemies of the people. His demise solidifies Zachariadis control of the party. Florakis was a noted communist statesman and one of the principle leaders of the reformist wing. Reformists are growing concern that the death of Florakis may pave the way for a wider purge in the party."
PDG.20.d:0 "Markos Vafeiadis, noted communist resistance and military leader was assassinated. The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the news and its determination to uncover all those involved in the plot. Details of the assassination have not been revealed. His views on socialism and forging an independent path for Greece made him opponents both within the party and internationally. It is unknown which of his opponents were involved. His death marks a major blow to his supporters in the party."
PDG.21.d:0 "President Charilaos Florakis was dismissed by communist party head Markos Vafeiadis. This marks a consolidation of power by Vafeiadis over the ruling reformist wing of the party. It appears the two men had a falling out over the policies being implemented. Experts believe Florakis was advocating a more inclusive, liberal vision for the country but Vafeiadis found it to be counter-revolutionary and divergent. Florakis, a statesman within the party, will likely go into retirement."
PDG.22.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced the execution of Nikos Zachariadis. The former party chairman was tried by a special court which found him guilty of counter-revolutionary activities and crimes against the people. Nikos Zachariadis led the party during the civil war and its early years, however, his hardline policies proved unpopular among reformists and many Greeks. His execution will strengthen the position of current party leader Markos Vafeiadis and offer a stark warning to those in the party that were sympathetic to Zachariadis."
PDG.23.d:0 "In a major announcement, the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG) announced its embrace of Titoism. The Greek government believes Titoism offers a more authentic and effective approach to developing socialism in the country. It also marks a rejection of the Soviet model. More importantly, it appears the DRG hopes to forge a more independent socialist model and foreign policy. This will gain much support among the people who are weary of Greece finding itself in a future international conflict."
PDG.24.d:0 "President Charilaos Florakis published news that former party chairman Nikos Zachariadis has been exiled from the Democratic Republic of Greece (DRG). As chairman and leader during the civil war, Zachariadis sought a hardline and rapid socialist transformation for the country. However, his policies largely alienated the reformist faction within the party and many Greeks. His exile will likely weaken his supporters within the party and pave the way for further reforms in the country." 
PDG.25.d:0 "The people of Greece are enjoying an unprecedented period of liberalism under President Charilaos Florakis. As leader of the communist party and the Democratic Republic of Greece, he has moved away from the hardline revolutionary approach and lifted many restrictions. Even before communist rule was established, Greeks had long been under restrictions, whether from authoritarian leaders, foreign occupiers, or wartime conditions. Florakis has ably implemented his reforms without provoking a countercoup."
PDG.26.d:0 "Reports from the Democratic Republic of Greece indicate the government is emptying its gulags. This marks the latest reform by President Charilaos Florakis. The Greek President recently initiated a series of liberal reforms to the state. Many Greeks will welcome the decision as many have loved ones detained in the facilities. More hardline members of the party are likely to be upset but so far President Florakis appears capable of managing the different factions of the party." 
PDG.27.d:0 "There is international outrage following reports that the Democratic Republic of Greece demolished the Church of Panagia Megalochari on Tinos. The church complex was built around a miraculous icon found by a nineteenth century nun. Greeks have visited the shrine for decades, claiming miracles have occurred. The communist government claims the shrine is a sham meant to poison the minds of the people and spread superstitions. The government claimed to have confiscated jewels and silver in the name of the people. The destruction of the historical and symbolic church will likely alienate a large number of Greeks."

PDG.28.d:0 "News of the Secret Speech and its contents have caused a stir within the ruling communist party in the Democratic Republic of Greece. The condemnation of Stalinism and calls for reforms in the implementation of socialism is proving controversial. Many communist leaders argue the Soviet shift represents a divergence away from socialism. The leadership of the party met in an emergency meeting. It was decided that the government will distance itself from Moscow as it assesses the impact of this new change."
PDG.29.d:0 "For many communists, the Greek Orthodox Church represents an institution of oppression and superstition. However, the church remains an important part of many of our people. The church also enjoys a high reputation for its role in the resistance and Greek independence. The party must decide how to deal with the church. One faction believes the party should crackdown on the church and work to end its dangerous influence. Another faction argues the church can be co-opted into the state, as is done in other socialist states. They argue the church can become a powerful vehicle to spread socialism to the masses."

PDG.30.d:0 "The Greek government requested our help in their goal of Enosis, the unification of Greece with Cyprus. Cyprus is currently under the colonial administration of Britain and is facing resistance from the majority Cypriote Greeks. It maybe in our interests to offer diplomatic support in order to position ourselves as champions for anti-colonialism. We can also offer the diplomatic support with covert aid to undermine the British. It would strengthen our position in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, if the risks of a Western reaction are too high, we can decline the Greek request."
PDG.31.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government could not offer any public or covert aid to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government expressed its sympathies for the anti-colonial struggle, but it cannot involve itself at this time. This is a major blow for our goals regarding Cyprus. The government must accept that it must support Cyprus on its own. There are some in the party openly questioning our own commitment to toeing the Soviet line internationally if they are unwilling to help us with such an important issue."
PDG.32.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government will offer diplomatic support to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government completely sympathizes with the anti-colonial struggle and desire of the people of Cyprus to unite with Greece. The ambassador added it was a crime that the unification has been delayed by centuries of imperialism and capitalist violence. However, the Soviet government cannot offer covert aid. This is a positive development, though it is disappointing the Soviets are unwilling to directly aid our efforts. We hope the political pressure brought to the British will push them to end their occupation."
PDG.33.d:0 "The Soviet ambassador informed us his government will offer diplomatic support to support us in Cyprus. The Soviet government completely sympathizes with the anti-colonial struggle and desire of the people of Cyprus to unite with Greece. The ambassador added it was a crime that the unification has been delayed by centuries of imperialism and capitalist violence. The Soviet government will also provide covert aid to support liberation efforts on Cyprus. The Soviet military attache and intelligence officer will soon begin coordinating with the Ministry of Defense. This is a major boost to our efforts on achieving Enosis."

#Turkey_Events
SRT.1.d:0 "Today the Soviet Military Government in Turkey under General Pavel Batov has announced the formal establishment of the Socialist Republic of Turkey. The General declared that by the end of the month, the 100,000 mostly Turkic soldiers of the Red Army will be withdrawn from Anatolia and authority will be transferred to the civilian government under General Secretary Sefik Husnu. International observers from both sides of the iron curtain expect the transition to be smooth and peaceful as Soviet soldiers leave the new nation as conquerors. The US and her allies can only watch in horror as the Soviet Steamroller claims another nation."
SRT.2.d:0 "The world stands still in grief today as the Socialist Republic of Turkey announced the sudden death of former president Ismet Inonu. Inonu was found dead in his bathroom with 7 gunshot wounds. The Communist Regime has already arranged a state funeral in his honor. While having been a vocal critic of communism, Inonu surprised the world by endorsing the Soviet Union as the preferable world leader. Whether this statement was made in fear of Soviet retaliation for a less-than-favorable endorsement, or genuine love for the working class is unknown. This, along with the identity of the assassin, is likely to remain a mystery for the foreseeable future."
SRT.3.d:0 "Immediately following the Death of Stalin, Turkish textile workers took to the streets demanding better pay. The next day, well-armed steelworkers and farmers from the outskirts of Ankara flocked to the protests. Outnumbered and outgunned, Soviet garrisons and the Turkish Police opened fire on a peaceful demonstration. What followed was a violent uprising as Turkish Protesters broke into the Ankara national armory. While at first being hailed as a triumph for freedom and democracy, the uprising devolved into a disorganized riot with widespread reports of looting and arson. The whereabouts of General Secretary Husnu are unknown, but rumor has it that he has fled the city along with the remaining members of the central government."
SRT.4.d:0 "For the first time in a month, the sun sets on a peaceful Ankara. General Secretary Sefik Husnu has announced to the world that order has been completely restored in the nation’s capital. Stability was restored thanks to the brilliant tactics and resolve of Propaganda Minister Guzin Dino and her friend Nazim Hikmet. The two artists turned revolutionaries secured control of the city without firing a shot by making strategic deals and concessions with individual rioting groups. The success of this strategy has given TKP officials the confidence to release a barrage of human-rights protections, including complete freedom to strike, the right to a legal defense in court, and outlets to express criticism with the Turkish state."
SRT.5.d:0 "Not one week since the riots began, stability has returned to Ankara. General Secretary Sefik Husnu has announced to the world that order has been completely restored in the nation’s capital. The speed at which this feat was accomplished can  be attributed solely to Husnu’s bruiser, Sevket Sureyya Aydemir. Known as an ideological fanatic to his colleagues and a hero to Turkish nationalists, Aydemir has found a new reputation with the people of Ankara as a butcher. Mere days after the riots started, Aydemir released the full might of the Turkish Army on the dissidents. Reports of indiscriminate fire quickly escalated into systematic and mass executions all throughout the city. While stability has returned to the city, many ask “at what cost?”"
SRT.7.d:0 "Many thought Ismet Inonu’s political career was finished after the Soviet takeover of Turkey. These beliefs, however, were proven wrong today when the former President and hero of the independence war gave a speech to the people of Turkey declaring their beloved national icon had returned to lead them once more. While domestic policy is rumored to be the same as the old regime, Inonus government has already begun the process of “Desovietization” which involves the expulsion of all Soviet troops, restoring Turkish nationalism, and cutting severing diplomatic ties with Moscow and the eastern bloc. It is clear that the short-lived communist era in Turkey is coming to an end however one question on both sides of the iron curtain remains; “what now for Turkey?”"

In his place, the Politburo has assumed total control of the nation. Before his exit, comrade Husnu has demanded the establishment of a pluralist leadership “based on  the values of compromise and solidarity”. Despite his request, it is clear battle lines are being drawn. On the far right of the politburo lies the TKP-CHP faction led by Kamalists loyal to the previous regime. They strongly believe Turkey should break with the International workers struggle and pursue positive neutrality. In the center lies the TKP establishment faction led by Khrushchevites loyal to Moscow. They believe the future of Turkey lies in solidarity with our comrades in the Warsaw pact. Finally, on the far-left lies the TKP-ML faction led by fanatic Turkish nationalists and anti-revisionists. Their vision for Turkey is a self-sufficient socialist state emphasizing technological progress and ideological loyalty. While officially, all factions work together, it is clear that in the coming months, there will be only one left."
