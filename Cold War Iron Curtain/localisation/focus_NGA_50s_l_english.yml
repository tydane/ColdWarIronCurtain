 nga50.1.d:0 "In response to increased demands of regional representation and growing independence movements in Nigeria, the crown has commissioned a constitutional council in Nigeria. With various proposals being unpopular, what will be most likely to be chosen in the future is the establishment of a council of ministers and federal assembly."
 nga50.2.d:0 "Ever since the combining of North and South Nigeria into a single colony, the entrepreneurial Igbos have migrating to the north in search of greater job opportunities. However, as many prosperous migrants do, they find themselves resented by their indigenous neighbors. This was made all so clear the past week during a series of riots in the Northern city of Kado where large sections of Igbo businesses and homes were destroyed by Northerners"
 nga50.3.d:0 "John Stuart Macpherson's productive time as a colonial governor has come to an end as his commission has completed itself and we welcome our new Governor, James Wilson Robertson. Macpherson oversaw multiple reforms and amendments to the constitution and continued to build the bond between the colonial regime and the more autocratic, loyal nobility and local leaders of the North. While the Northerners and Yoruba might politely gesture off Macpherson, many Igbo have not felt any attention brought from him to their region and will see him as another uneventful colonial governor."
 nga50.4.d:0 "The joint venture of British Petroleum and the Royal Dutch Shell Company have begun large scale surveying of resources in the colony and protectorate of Nigeria. With surveying reaching all major regions of Nigeria, we will see what economic value Nigeria has outside of its current agricultural role in cash crops like Cotton and Rubber."*Due to the divisive nature of the regions of Nigeria and their political divides resting on ethnic lines, there has been a great call for a right to succeed to be placed at the hand of each federal state. Surprisingly, the primarily Igbo National Council of Nigeria and Cameroon (NCNC) has spoken out against this, claiming it could easily destroy any new Nigerian state."
 nga50.6.d:0 "This year, a major political party was founded by chief Obafemi Awolowo, a truly self made journalist who established his own newspaper several years ago. The party advocates for generally social democratic policies similar to the labor party in the United Kingdom, however is seen by many as simply a Yoruba interests first party. "
 nga50.7.d:0 "Ever since the combining of the Nigerian northern and southern colonies the British have favored the more authoritarian organized north to strengthen the Empire's indirect rule in the region. In an attempt to gain more control over the resources of the nation, the United Kingdom has continued this approach into the 1950s where it found itself unable to take the correct constitutional reform to keep the ethnic tension of Nigeria at bay. This has now inevitably lead to the moment at hand where Nnamdi Azikiwe's NCNC is leading an independent Igbo Republic, while simultaneously in the west, Obafemi Awolowo's Action Group has declared an independent Yoruban state known as the Oduduwa Republic."
 nga50.8.d:0 "In ending the rebellions of the nation we have come to an agreeable solution in the recent accords, to divide Nigeria into a loose confederation between a northern Muslim half and the southern Christian and ingenious beliefs half. Northern and Southern both find this solution suitable as it will essentially create de-facto to separate Nigerian nations that still will be represented together in diplomatic and trade agreements around the world. Another stipulation of the agreement is that both halves of Nigeria are at liberty to declare independence at anytime (in theory) through a public referendum."
