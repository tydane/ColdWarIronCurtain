It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

The M24 has 38mm of armor and a 75mm main gun. The engine is a V8 twin Cadillac with a Hydramatic transmission that can move roughly the same as the M5 Stuart. In combat, the M5 Stuart's small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign. It was short after this that the M24 Chaffee was developed with the intention of giving it more firepower to better serve its role."

 USA_lt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The M41 is a light recon tank developed by Cadillac in 1949. It saw combat in Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, Lebanon, and Somalia. Its armor ranges from 19mm to 31.7mm. It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

 USA_lt_equipment_4_short:0 "T92"
 USA_lt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T92 is a light recon tank developed by Aircraft Armaments in 1954. It was designed quickly to replace the failure of the M41 bulldog and featured a low profile and extremely light weight. Despite this, it was never accepted into service. Very little information is available on the prototype, but it was designed as an airborne tank that could be airdropped and weighed only 15 tons. The T92 is primarily based off of the Soviet PT92 design. The T92 saw combat during testing exercises and the War Over The Last Donut in the Mess Hall. The WOTLD occurred when 2 of the testing crew verbally argued over who is the bigger fatass and who should get the donut. Whether the tank was present in the Mess Hall or even within' a mile of this conflict and whether it was fired is currently unknown."

The M551 Sheridan has a 152mm main gun and 2 secondary guns. The tank has a 6V53T 6 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine and a speed up to 43 mph and a swimming speed of 3.6 mph. The armor is an aluminum hull with a steel turret. It was immediately rushed into service in Vietnam because of its mobility and versatility where it served an exceptional role. The 152mm main gun can launch an ATGM or conventional ammunition respectively. The M551 was criticized by many of its operators due to the difficulty of use in direct combat but still served its role effectively despite its poor reputation."

The tank, despite being a heavy tank, only had 83mm armor. It was armed with 2 main guns. One of them was a 76.2mm and the other was a 37mm. The tank has 4 secondary MG armaments. The tank had a G-200 9 cylinder gasoline tank with a Timken mechanical 3 speed transmission and a horizontal volute spring to support its 57.4 ton mass. It has an operational range of 100 miles and a speed of 22 mph but as a result, needs to use 477 gallons of fuel to move this distance. It was eventually decided that the M6 was not worth the expense of development and the project was cancelled with 40 unfinished test prototypes being used in the field."

It has a 105mm main gun turret and 3 secondary mgs. The armor was significantly greater than the M6 with 102-279mm of armor. The engine was a 27 liter GAC V12 gasoline engine with a cross-drive transmission. Unlike the M6, the T29 used the traditional torsion-bar suspension that was used on most early tanks. It had a maximum speed of 22 mph and an operational range of 100 miles using only 300 gallons in this period making it more efficient than the M6. The project was initiated to counter the Tiger II but was ultimately cancelled because the war had been won mid-development."

It replaced the M103's engine with an AVDS1790-2 V12 twin turbocharged engine, granting it significant advantages over the M103. The improved engine could carry it 295 miles at 23 mph and had significant mobility using the same fuel as the M103. There were also some minor other improvements made to the parts of the M103 such as a slightly different model of transmission but was ultimately the same. The M103A2 was the last heavy tank created by the US because main battle tanks supplanted the need for heavy tanks and could carry more firepower with less weight and more mobility."

 USA_sht_equipment_3_desc:0 "The R32 is an experimental nuclear superheavy tank designed by Chrysler in the 50s. The R32 never reached prototype phase but some parts were manufactured. The R32 was designed to carry a nuclear powered electric engine and a 120mm main gun with 3 secondary MGs. The nuclear engine was estimated to give it a speed of 40 mph and an almost limitless travelling range as a result of nuclear power being its source of fuel. The armor was designed to be 127-254mm thick. The project was cancelled quickly after its inception due to a large number of hangups in the lack of technology needed to create the design and skepticism on behalf of the US General Staff in charge of funding the project."

The Sherman can wield a 75mm, 76mm or 105mm main gun and typically had a browning secondary gun. It is propelled by a C4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine capable of transporting the vehicle at 22-30 mph over 100-150 miles before needing refueling. It was reliable, cheap to produce, and a logician's wet dream. It was very compact and easy to transport in large numbers which made shipping the vehicle across the Atlantic extremely easy. The M4 was also very versatile and was capable of operating in a large variety of conditions."

 USA_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M26 Pershing is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1944. It saw combat in WWII and in the Korean war. The M26 Pershing is notably heavy for a medium tank with an exceptionally poor off-road speed as a result of this. Its 8-cylinder Ford GAF engine could carry it up to 100 miles at 30 mph on road but off-road it clocks at 5.25 mph. Its main gun is a 90mm cannon and can wield a M2 browning. However, during the Korean war the .50 caliber M2 browning was swapped for 2 M1919 .30-06 guns due to the large quantity of soft targets in the field and the need to carry 9x the ammunition rather than more firepower. The M26 may have been a medium tank, but it is extremely heavy and can be considered to be a hybrid medium/heavy tank."

 USA_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The M46 Patton is a medium tank designed by the US Army Ordnance Department in 1949. It saw combat in the Korean War and was designed to replace the M26 Pershing due to its inordinate weight. It features a 90mm main gun and 102mm armor. It can be equipped with a single M2 Browning or dual M1919 Brownings. The M46 Patton uses a V12 twin-turbo engine that clocks up to 15-30 mph and has an operational range of 30-80 miles. It was heavily mass produced in an attempt to replace the former designs. It was in date with modern designs and weapons and did not suffer from heavy weight."

The engine is an optimized variant of the V12 used in prior Patton tanks with a light fuel injection system and is supercharged. It has an operation range off-road of 160 miles and 300 miles on-road. It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

It has approximately 220mm of armor and carries a 105mm main gun. It typically used the M73 7.62x51mm machine gun as its secondary armament. The engine is an improved V12 twin-turbo engine that can move about the same speed as the M48. However, despite weighing slightly more than the M48, the M60 can move about the same speed and across the same difference. The M60 underwent many different minor changes throughout its life and has approximately 4 variants as a result of this. This meant increases in the armor, the weight and improvements to reliability."

The M1 uses composite 350mm armor. Its primary cannon is a 105mm main gun with either 1 .50 caliber or 2 .7.62 caliber secondary guns. The engine is a multi-fuel turbine engine and it can move at 45 mph on and 30 mph offroad. It has an operational range of about 265 miles on or 200 miles off road. It doesn't use the MBT70's suspension but instead torsion bar suspension with shock absorbers. It has demonstrated considerable effectivity in every US conflict since its inception. The M1 Abrams has become iconic due to its considerable toughness, mobility, and firepower. A lot of its improvements come from lessons learned from the MBT-70 project where useful features were kept but more troublesome ones were abandoned."

The tanks also come with optional additions such as reactive armor, an urban survival kit, and a remotely operated weapon system. It has a 120mm main smoothbore gun and outranges most other tanks. It also has improved electronics, ATGM countermeasures, and a firefighting system. However, no improvements to the transmission, suspension, or engine were made and as such, sits closer to the ground and weighs significantly more. It can move on road at 42 mph or off road at 25 mph with a shorter operational range. It has been used in Afghanistan, the Gulf, and Iraq where it has demonstrated unparalleled survivability against most anti-tank weapons that its opponents have fielded."

It was designed by N Shashmyrin and Zh Kotin in 1951 and around 12,000 units were made. It requires a 3 man crew and a V6 straight six engine with a speed of 44 km/h and can swim at 10 km/h. It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

It has a lengthened chassis an a stronger, improved turret. It also has a larger main gun, a 85mm. The engine was also optimized to increase speed along with the increased weight. It also contained the ATGM that was initially intended to be added to the PT71. The tank's design was not manufactured outside of the DPRK and as such, has not seen any known combat."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-44"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-44 is a medium Soviet tank made closer to the end of WWII. It provided improved mobility and greater armor with a heavier 85mm main gun. It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-54"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_short:0 "T-55"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_short:0 "T-62"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "

 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_short:0 "T-64"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The T-64 is a Soviet MBT that introduced numerous modernizations over the T-62 and can be called a continuation of the improvements made from the T-55 to the T-62. It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_6:0 "T-72"

 SOV_mbt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The T-72 is a Soviet MBT created as a new generation of tanks, mostly to replace the T-62 and its expensive counterpart the T-64. It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7:0 "T-80"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_short:0 "T-80"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_7_desc:0 "The T-80 is a Soviet MBT designed following the doctrine of high mobility the T-72 set. The KMBD began designing it in 1964 and finished in 1975 after 11 years of work. The hull itself is made of improved, thickened composite armor and comes with an improved smoothbore gun. It also can come equipped with a rocket armament for improved firepower. It has a smaller range than the T-72 and slightly slower speeds despite having a more advanced transmission and gas turbine engine. It saw conflict in the Chechen wars and the war in Donbass but was not extensively used as much as the T-72 was."

 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_short:0 "T-90"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_8_desc:0 "After the T-80 failed to replace the T-72 or display significantly greater capabilities, Kartsev-Venediktov sought to further improve the tank and introduce better capability than the T-80. The design was finished around 1990. The engine was replaced with a 12 cylinder diesel engine and was slower than even the T-80, but held much higher firepower. The gun was upgraded, the fire control system was improved, the armor was thickened substantial and many more auxiliaries were added including a ATGM jammer and smoke dischargers. It has seen combat in Dagestan and Donbass. "
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9:0 "Black Eagle"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_short:0 "Black Eagle"
 SOV_mbt_equipment_9_desc:0 "The Black Eagle was intended to be an improved MBT designed by KBTM in the late 1990s but has been presumably cancelled after the company went bankrupt and imploded and it was decided that the T-80s chassis, which the Black Eagle was based off of, was of low-quality. The Black Eagle would have featured Explosive Reactive armor and a much greater 152mm gun in one variant but a 120mm in another. The engine would have been a gas turbine engine with more mobility and speed than the T-90, matching up roughly to the T-80. The would take lessons from the T-90 and T-80 and create a tank that would have been more reliable than either tank. 3 prototypes were constructed."

It was exported to various Soviet-sphere and Soviet-leaning countries and as such as seen a recon role in virtually all conflicts of Soviet-sphere nations. However, it is still in use by many countries today due to its famous reliability and ease of maintenance."

The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h.

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."

It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east.

Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it.

The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design.

The Black Eagle would have featured Explosive Reactive armor and a much greater 152mm gun in one variant but a 120mm in another. The engine would have been a gas turbine engine with more mobility and speed than the T-90, matching up roughly to the T-80. The T-95 would take lessons from the T-90 and T-80 and create a tank that would have been more reliable than either tank. 3 prototypes were constructed."

The engine is a V8 twin Cadillac with a Hydramatic transmission that can move roughly the same as the M5 Stuart. In combat, the M5 Stuart's small cannon proved to be a significant shortcoming, especially in the North African campaign. It was short after this that the M24 Chaffee was developed with the intention of giving it more firepower to better serve its role."

It is armed with a 76mm main gun, a .30 cal coaxial machine gun, and a .50 cal roof gun. It uses a Continental 6 cylinder petrol engine and runs up to 45 mph with an operational range of 100 miles. The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

It was designed quickly to replace the failure of the M41 bulldog and featured a low profile and extremely light weight. Despite this, it was never accepted into service. Very little information is available on the prototype, but it was designed as an airborne tank that could be airdropped and weighed only 15 tons. The T92 is primarily based off of the Soviet PT92 design. The T92 saw combat during testing exercises and the War Over The Last Donut in the Mess Hall. The WOTLD occurred when 2 of the testing crew verbally argued over who is the bigger fatass and who should get the donut. Whether the tank was present in the Mess Hall or even within' a mile of this conflict and whether it was fired is currently unknown."

The M551 Sheridan has a 152mm main gun and 2 secondary guns. The tank has a 6V53T 6 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine and a speed up to 43 mph and a swimming speed of 3.6 mph. The armor is an aluminum hull with a steel turret. It was immediately rushed into service in Vietnam because of its mobility and versatility where it served an exceptional role. The 152mm main gun can launch an ATGM or conventional ammunition respectively. The M551 was criticized by many of its operators due to the difficulty of use in direct combat but still served its role effectively despite its poor reputation."

Due to the M8s cancellation and the cessation of production of the M551 in 1997, there was a long period of time where the US was without any recon tanks. It would not be until 2016 where the M1128 would eventually begin production to fill that role. The M8 would have had aluminum armor and a 105mm main gun with long-range anti-tank capability. The engine in the prototypes varied greatly and no engine was settled although the 6V 92TIA from the Detroit Diesel Corporation was the best candidate that had an offroad speed of 30 miles per hour. The tank first saw combat in some fields outside Detroit where the prototypes were tested and then again when an officer from the local base got approval to take it for a joyride and he accidentally ran over a squirrel."

The tank, despite being a heavy tank, only had 83mm armor. It was armed with 2 main guns. One of them was a 76.2mm and the other was a 37mm. The tank has 4 secondary MG armaments. The tank had a G-200 9 cylinder gasoline tank with a Timken mechanical 3 speed transmission and a horizontal volute spring to support its 57.4 ton mass. It has an operational range of 100 miles and a speed of 22 mph but as a result, needs to use 477 gallons of fuel to move this distance.

The engine was a 27 liter GAC V12 gasoline engine with a cross-drive transmission. Unlike the M6, the T29 used the traditional torsion-bar suspension that was used on most early tanks. It had a maximum speed of 22 mph and an operational range of 100 miles using only 300 gallons in this period making it more efficient than the M6.

It had 178-300mm of steel armor. The T30 used an AV1790-3 engine with the same suspension and transmission of the T29.

The improved engine could carry it 295 miles at 23 mph and had significant mobility using the same fuel as the M103. There were also some minor other improvements made to the parts of the M103 such as a slightly different model of transmission but was ultimately the same. The M103A2 was the last heavy tank created by the US because main battle tanks supplanted the need for heavy tanks and could carry more firepower with less weight and more mobility."

Though performances were satisfactory, the Yugoslav military did not adopt the rifle at the time for various reasons.\n\nIn 1970, green light was given to begin army-funded mass production of the M70 and M70A series (Automatska Puska Model 1970, \"Automatic Rifle Model 1970\") of which the M70A was the folding stock version.

The major difference between the two forms is the stock to which the M80 is the base version with a fixed, solid wooden stock while the M80A is the compact version with the folding metal wire stock.

The M249 has been used in every major conflict involving the US since the invasion of Panama. Because of its lighter weight and higher reliability, it functions better than the M60 in non-urban controlled environments and works better as an offensive squad weapon. In fact, the M249 was initially commissioned to replace the M60 as a lighter weapon./nThe M32 Grenade Launcher is a US variant of the squad revolver grenade launcher the Milkor MGL. The Milkor was developed in 1980 by Andries Piek for South Africa, and is a notable step up as a squad grenade launcher from the M79. The US Marine Corps adopted it and made minor modifications to create the M32 variant. It can be loaded to hold up to 6 shots and rapid fire them all within 2 seconds. It can significantly increase a squad's firepower with its burst capability. Additionally, the launcher has been adopted by law enforcement agencies globally for use with non-lethal grenade rounds such as smoke. It has been used in the Rwandan Civil War and the Colombian conflict."

In addition to this, the standard aiming reticule is a simple black \"T\" which makes it extremely difficult to use during twilight hours or on a black target.\nSome serious complaints about the accuracy of the sniper version are linked to the poorly conceived attachment system for the scope. The scope goes askew easily because it is only affixed with one screw. After the scope is mounted and the rifle is zeroed, it is imperative that it be handled carefully because it is easily jostled. Furthermore, since the scope is not usually assigned to any particular rifle it is often difficult to keep it static on any particular rifle's receiver. This is usually corrected by installing a piece of cloth between the receiver and scope mount, but then the iron sights of the rifle are obscured. In cases like this, it is necessary to install a cheek pad to properly align the users eye with the scope."

The M1 Garand is a .30 caliber semi-automatic rifle that saw extensive use during WWII. It is amongst the first weapons to use a gas reloading system to rechamber a new round after firing. It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti tankantitank rifle grenade. It functions as an all purpose weapon with an exceptional range and accuracy. It became symbolic and is still used by modern drill teams in the US.."

In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

The weapon shares some outward and inward similarities with the American M16 and includes functions of the Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 as well.\nThe K2 sports clean lines typical of Daewoo products and bears a resemblance to the American AR-18/Colt M16 automatic rifles. Essentially, the K2 is an M16 in nature but with the proven gas system of the Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle. As such, the Korean design does away with the direct impingement system and gas fouling inherent in the Stoner-based M16 line. The K2 makes use of standard M16 STANAG curved magazines and fires the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge from a 20- or 30-round magazine."

The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."
